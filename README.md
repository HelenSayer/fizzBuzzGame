# **FixxBuzz Game**

## **Challenge**

Your challenge is to write some tests for the FizzBuzz game.

FizzBuzz is a classic programming problem that is often asked as an interview question. Create a function called fizzBuzz. This function should take in number as a parameter. The function should do the following:

If the number is divisible by 3 and 5, then return "FizzBuzz"
If the number is divisible by 3, then return "Fizz"
If the number is divisible by 5, then return "Buzz"
Else just return the number

Write a set of tests that pass in various values to the FizzBuzz function and ensure that the function meets the above requirements. Make sure that you test all different "types" of inputs that the function may receive.

### **Project**

I have tried to work through the challenge following the example given in the CI training videos.

For each step I have saved the Jasmine files: fizzBuzzSpecStep01.js, fizzBuzzSpecStep02, etc.

And for each step I have saved the corresponding JavaScript files in the same way:
fizzBuzzStep01.js, fizzBuzzStep02.js etc.

- step01 and step02 refers to Red-Green-Refactor.
- step03 and step08 refer to Test suites.
